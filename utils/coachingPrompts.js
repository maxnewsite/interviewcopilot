Focus on creating very specific, targeted questions that dig deep into the current topic.

Balance between understanding the situation and moving toward solutions.
Questions should encourage both reflection and forward movement.`,

Guidelines for powerful coaching questions:
- Use open-ended questions that cannot be answered with yes/no
- Keep questions short and clear (ideally under 15 words)
- Focus on the coachee's thoughts, feelings, and actions
- Avoid "why" questions when possible (use "what" or "how" instead)
- Include questions that challenge assumptions
- Ensure questions are non-judgmental and curious
